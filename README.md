# Beam-Propagation-Method
Our model based on the beam propagation method calculates the wavefront propagation in the scattering medium with the scattering mean free path and anisotropy factor characterized.






Notes:
1. The layer distance d should be smaller than or equal to the scattering mean free path ls.
