# Beam-Propagation-Method
Our model based on the beam propagation method calculates the wavefront propagation in the scattering medium with the scattering mean free path and anisotropy factor characterized.

After you run the demo provided, the

Notes:
1. The layer distance d should be smaller than or equal to the scattering mean free path ls.
